I personally think this lab was a major improvement over the last one.
I don't think any of the actual coding was too difficult, although I personally had some trouble using the BigInteger class at first and I also had some initial trouble parsing the data from the SQS and DynamoDB.
I think the lack of full direction is a better way to learn since it forces us to use critical thinking to solve the problem set out before us.
That being said, I can also see how there was a lot of unrelated concepts being introduced for most students in this lab.
While I have personally used maven a lot in industry, it is unintuitive to someone who has likely exclusively ran Java programs through the IDE and dropped jar file dependencies into their project setup in the IDE up until this point.
The use of BigInteger, could be introduced in an earlier lab/course (and maybe it was, and I'm the odd one out on that) to ensure there is some familiarity with it before going into the lab.
One way to introduce the concept of a Lambda to students for the first time would be to use a metaphor they would be familiar with.
For example in the C++ course I'm taking with a lot of the same classmates, there was an assignment with an already written main function that called class methods that we had to write.
The lambda is the same as the class method, just instead of a main method with code we can see, it's being called by AWS's black box.
